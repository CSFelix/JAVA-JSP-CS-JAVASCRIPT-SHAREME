# 🌟 ShareMe 🌟

----
### `❓ What's it? ❓`

* ShareMe is a website to upload, send and download files like FromSmash, Sendspace and WeTransfer (if you dunno what is these websites, I let it's links above). You can send files in any format (in my testes, no one extension presents error during the up and download) untill 15 MB of storage. 

* WebSites' Links:

```
- WeTransfer: https://wetransfer.com
- SendSpace: https://www.sendspace.com
- FromSmash: https://www.fromsmash.com
```

### `⚒️ Tools ⚒️`

* Eclipse IDE;
* TomCat 9 version or later;
* Giphy (gifs!!);
* Java version 13 or later;
* CSS, JavaScript;
* Any Browser (tested succesfully in Google Chrome, Opera, Opera GX and Microsoft Edge);
* MongoDB 4.2.2 version or later;
* MongoDB driver to Java 3.12.7 or later.

----
### `⚙️ Run ⚙️`

> MongoDB

* Start mongodb service;
* Create a database called **chateme**;
* Into this database, create a bucket collection called **shareme_arquivos_bucket**;
* Leave the 27017 port free for this application.

> Application

* Downlaod the source code (I suggest only the *war* file and the driver);
* Import the files into your Eclipse IDE;
* Set the mongodb file into the *lib* folder of the project (if the driver is already there, you don't needa do this step);
* Start TomCat server;
* Open **index.jsp** file on the browser.

### `🎁 Bonus 🎁`
